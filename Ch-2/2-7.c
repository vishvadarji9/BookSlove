//!2.7 Given two integers 20 and 10, write a program that uses a function add( ) to add these two numbers and sub( ) to find the difference of these two numbers and then display the sum and difference in the following form:
//! 20 + 10 = 30
//! 20 â€“ 10 = 10

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 20;
    int b = 10;
    printf("%d + %d = %d\n",a,b,(a+b));
    printf("%d - %d = %d\n",a,b,(a-b));
    return 0;
}
